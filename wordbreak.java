//Accepted on leetcode.
//So the aim is to identify if the given string can be broken into valid words (or words present in the given dictionary).
//First I would take a dp array of boolean type with size 1 more than the original string size.
//Also I would take a hashset with all the words in the dictionary to keep track of the words we come across.
//now the 0th place in the dp I would initialize it to True marking the beginning index of our first word.
//Further, We iterate over the given string from the 1st index through the end. And i keep a 'j' index that starts from 1 index lesser than the 'i' and decrement until 0.
//our j is considered the end of the substring and i as the start of the substring.
//at each 'i'th position we check if there are any valid words between j and i index if so we mark the 'i'th index in our dp array as True and break
//after which our j index will be at the place that was last marked True.
//This process is repeated through the end of the string and the last position in the dp array is returned which is the result.
