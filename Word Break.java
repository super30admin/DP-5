// Time Complexity : O(n^2), n is string length
// Space Complexity : O(n + m), n is string length (dp array), m is wordDict size (HashSet)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this :



//DP 
//TC : O(n^2), n is string length
//SC : O(n + m), n is string length (dp array), m is wordDict size (HashSet)
//we will find the word from len j to i in dic, if dp[j] is true
//dp[0] is set true, as j is considered to be empty string at start, so we set to true
//we check at each index of j thats true, we check if substring of j-i (inclusive) is present in wordDict
//if yes, we make dp[i] to true
//if word can be split using worddcit, last index will be true
