At any given cell we can either come from top or its left cell as robot can only move down right and bottom.
for the first row cells there is only one way to reach i.e from left cell, hence we initialise it with 1
similary for first column cells we can only reach those from top cell, hence we also initialise those as 1
for all other cells we add values in its left cell and top cell
the last entry of matrix gives us the answer
